      <h1>Grandview Healthcare Solutions</h1>
      <h2>Manitoba Community Healthcare Advocacy Group</h2>
      <p>
        Grandview Healthcare Solutions, established in 2017, grew out of a
        community response from Grandview and Tootinaowaziibeeng Treaty Reserve
        to maintain the Grandview Emergency Medical Services station as an
        essential service of the local healthcare system for both communities
        and surrounding areas. The role of the group has expanded to advocate
        that the Grandview District Hospital be maintained as an acute care
        facility with 24/7 Emergency Service. The group promotes keeping
        Healthcare close to home in rural Manitoba and supports the Grandview
        Healthcare model as a viable system, essential for the health of all
        community members.
