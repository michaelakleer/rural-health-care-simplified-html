            In 2017, Grandview Healthcare Solutions, a community advocacy group
            from Grandview, Manitoba, commissioned a community research project
            on the implications of emergency healthcare cuts within their
            community. Researchers from McMaster University, with roots in rural
            Manitoba and Ontario, undertook this study, analyzing government
            reports and policies, and interviewing community members. The
            results of this project, 'Keeping Rural Health Care Close to Home'
            are shared here.

                  continued to advocate for healthcare services close to home
                  for Grandview and Tootinaowaziibeeng, and attended meetings
                  with Prairie Mountain Health and Manitoba Shared Health. The
                  group monitored the release of all healthcare related
                  government reports, worked with the municipal government to
                  aid in the recruitment of doctors, and organized and hosted

                  November 25, Prairie Mountain Health announced the closure of
                  Grandview District Hospital effective November 26, to move
                  hospital staff to the Grandview Personal Care Home to deal
                  with a Covid 19 outbreak. Grandview Healthcare Solutions
                  arranged a car rally for the morning of November 26 to escort
                  patients from Grandview Hospital being moved to Dauphin
                  Hospital. This served as a community protest on not being
                  consulted about the hospital closure and the possibility of
                  other solutions. The group continued to advocate for the
                  reopening of the hospital. Chief and Council of
                  Tootnaowaziibeeng Treaty Reserve posted their letter to the
                  Manitoba Government, in local newspapers, that they would be
                  taking legal actions if the hospital was not reopened. Prairie
                  Mountain Health reopened the Grandview District Hospital
                  December 21, 2020.
